# Theoretical Questions
## What are the benefits of using Python language as a language?
Python appears to be one of the easier langauges to get into and provides more support for coding. <br>It has a lot of already defined modules and functions that are available to use from the beginning. 
<br>Great help guides and beign one of the most popular languages allows for faster problem solving and information gathering.
<br>One of the best choices for machine learning as well.
## What are it's drawbacks?
It is a high-level language which makes creating programs for low-level harder than when using other languages(ex. C).
<br>It is slower and clumsier compared to less cluttered options.
## What is the difference between a Tuple and List in Python?
Syntax for list is [], for tuple is ().
<br>Tuples cannot be dynamically changes while Lists can.
## Is Indentation Required in Python?
Yes, most defenitely! 
<br>Indentation is mandatory and incorrectly stating it will cause errors and undesired work.
<br>It is good that by default when creating a program the indentation is set automatically when needed and the tools used like **vscode** also are visibly showing.
## Difference between for loop and while loop in Python.
## What is List Comprehension, why do we need it and is it faster than a loop for list creation? Give an Example.
## What are unit tests in Python?
Unit tests are a code that covers other written code like functions or methods.
## What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?
## What are Decorators?
## When a parameter is passed to a function, is it by value (copy) or reference (pointer)?
## Does Python support multiple Inheritance (OOP)?
